# factor_belief — the Slice C stage C0 probe

**EXPLORATORY — sits below every evidentiary tier and is cited by nothing
above it.** A probe number becomes quotable only by brief amendment that
adds it to a verifier receipt.

Instrument: `walt/walt/src/bin/factorbelief.rs`. Gates (the CI-checked
part): `walt/walt/tests/solver_factor_belief.rs`. Mathematical source:
`walt/math/counted_belief_sandwich_v0.1.md` §21–22, §26, §46 stage C0,
rulings CBS-A6/CBS-A9.

## What it measures

Two routes to the same exact one-ply branch masses `{t ↦ Z_ht}` for the
first hidden seat after the viewer's lowest legal focal play:

- **contraction** — enumerate the acting seat's possible ROOT hands,
  weight each by its exact compatible-completion count (`pair_count`, one
  binomial per hand), classify each hand ONCE by the field (§21's boxed
  equation);
- **enumeration** — classify every complete world of the fiber one by
  one.

Route parity and `Z_h = Σ_t Z_ht` are asserted on every row, and
independently gated in CI on the same roots.

- **The §22 representation change is real.** Section C: the opening root
  (h0-t1, fiber 399,072,960) yields its exact branch table in **8.7 ms**
  — 116,280 acting-seat hands classified once each, completion weights
  8.5 ms of that, no complete world ever materialized. The fiber mass
  itself is counted by the shipped DP in 13 µs. Conservation is exact:
  the fifteen branch masses sum to 399,072,960 on the nose.
- **Distinct information states = distinct hands, on both routes.**
  Section B: the level-0 field's insert-only cache materializes exactly
  as many states as the contraction route classifies hands (6/6, 15/15,
  28/28, 74/74) — the enumeration route's extra work is all cache hits.
  At these fiber sizes (worlds/hands ≈ 3) the two routes therefore cost
  about the same; the contraction advantage is the RATIO, which at the
  opening root is 3,432 and at richer roots is unbounded by any sample.
- **The trivial-field contraction is µs-scale everywhere** (Section A:
  4–14 µs against 4–94 µs enumeration; the gap already grows with fiber
  size at 200 worlds).
- **The branch tables differ between fields** (lowest-first vs the σ0
  modeled mind pick different tiles from the same hands — e.g. h4-t6's
  2-2/5-1 masses move). Nothing here ranks fields; the probe only
  demonstrates that the posterior machinery tracks whichever field is
  declared.

## opening_level0_run1.txt readings (2026-08-30)

`factorbelief opening-level0` — the deliberate expensive coordinate:
level-0 (`n0 = 2`) classification of all 116,280 opening hands — §46
stage C2's shape realized with the σ0 field.

- **The exact opening action distribution of the modeled mind exists and
  costs 5.6 seconds.** All 116,280 hands classified (~48 µs per
  modeled-mind read), 20 distinct branch tiles, conservation exact over
  399,072,960. The §22 claim is now a measurement: the first hidden
  seat's exact posterior action distribution under σ0 never touches a
  complete world.
- **Cost attribution is total:** counting is 8.5 ms of the 5.6 s —
  field classification is >99.8% of the bill, exactly the compression
  problem §22 predicted ("a separate compression problem, not a reason
  to retain complete worlds as the belief representation").
- **No reuse at the opening root:** every hand is a distinct
  information state (116,280 materialized), so caching buys nothing
  within one root — cross-root and cross-action reuse is where C1's
  cache study must look, and hand-class instrumentation (Slice F) is
  the declared route to compressing the classifier itself.

## Boundaries

- Deterministic fields only; a stochastic field needs an explicit tape
  factor (CBS-A6 boundary obligation) and has no entry point here.
- One conditioned factor at most (the declared C0 domain); contraction
  across two tables is Slice D and is refused by panic, not approximated.
- One-ply only: no recursion, no value claims, no play-strength readings.
